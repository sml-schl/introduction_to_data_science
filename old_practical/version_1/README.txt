Introduction to Data Science â€” Jupyter Notebooks (auto-generated)
Based on the supplied lecture slides (IntroductionToDataScienceCourse-Masterfile-new.pdf).

Contents (student + solution notebooks):
- Day2_student.ipynb / Day2_solutions.ipynb  (Intro & Visualization)
- Day4_student.ipynb / Day4_solutions.ipynb  (Data Preparation & Feature Engineering)
- Day6_student.ipynb / Day6_solutions.ipynb  (Intro to Machine Learning)
- Day8_student.ipynb / Day8_solutions.ipynb  (Model Evaluation & CV)

Dataset used: seaborn's 'titanic' dataset (loaded in the first code cell of each notebook).
If you prefer a local CSV, you can export the dataframe in the notebook and save it.

How to run:
1. Open the notebooks in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / Colab.
2. Run cells top-to-bottom. If packages are missing, uncomment the pip install lines at the top.

Instructor notes:
- Designed for ~90 minutes per day (mix of reading, short exercises, coding).
- Solutions notebooks include explanations and sometimes alternative solutions where useful.

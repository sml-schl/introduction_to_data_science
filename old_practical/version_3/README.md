### Why Titanic?
- Perfect for learning: manageable size (~891 passengers)
- Rich feature set: numerical and categorical variables
- Real missing values and outliers to practice handling
- Interesting for both classification and regression tasks
- Historical context makes insights engaging

### Features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier
- **Survived**: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes) - TARGET VARIABLE
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger name
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare (¬£)
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

The dataset is automatically loaded from seaborn's built-in datasets, so no manual download is required!

## üìñ Learning Tips

### For Students

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Read all markdown cells carefully
- Try to complete exercises before checking solutions
- Experiment with the code
- Run cells multiple times with different parameters
- Ask questions and discuss with peers
- Complete bonus challenges if time permits

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Skip to solutions without attempting exercises
- Copy-paste code without understanding it
- Rush through the material
- Ignore error messages (they teach you!)

### For Instructors

**Timing Guidance:**
- Each notebook is designed for 90 minutes
- Adjust based on student pace and questions
- Bonus challenges for faster students
- Reflection questions foster discussion

**Teaching Tips:**
- Demonstrate concepts before letting students try

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Module Not Found Error**
```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotly'
```
**Solution:** Install the missing library:
```bash
pip install plotly
```

**2. Kernel Died / Notebook Won't Run**
**Solution:** Restart the kernel: `Kernel > Restart Kernel`

**3. Visualizations Not Showing**
**Solution:**
- For Plotly: Make sure you're using a modern browser
- Try: `pip install plotly --upgrade`

**4. Dataset Won't Load**
**Solution:**
```python
# The Titanic dataset loads automatically with seaborn
import seaborn as sns
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
```

**5. Out of Memory Errors**
**Solution:** Close other applications, restart Jupyter
